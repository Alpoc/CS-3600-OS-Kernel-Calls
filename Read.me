Assignment 5: kernel calls
Due date: Sunday, July 30, 2017, 11:55 PM
Maximum number of files: 1
Type of work: Individual work
Add kernel calls to your VirtuOS project. Do this by creating a pair of pipes to every child process (in each PCB). A kernel call is made by putting a request in the pipe from the child to the kernel and then sending the kernel a SIGTRAP. You'll need to create a SIGTRAP ISR that reads the request and sends back a response. Implement at least the listing of the names of all the current processes and the system time, and implement a child process that requests both. Here are two files that demonstrate using pipes and traps.
